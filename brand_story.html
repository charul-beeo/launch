      <h1>Our Story</h1>

      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          Line &amp; Lustre is the art of the intentional. It is where quiet discipline meets an expressive soul.
          Rooted in the serene minimalism of Scandinavian design and inspired by the intricate richness of Asian artistry,
          we create jewelry that speaks without shouting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born in Grimstad, Norway, a small coastal town far from the noise of the fashion capitals, Line &amp; Lustre began
          with a simple conviction: modern jewelry should feel personal, expressive, and empowering, without being inaccessible.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Norway, much of the market sits at two extremes, very minimal basics or expensive fine pieces that do not always
          justify the premium. Line &amp; Lustre exists between those points: thoughtfully curated pieces with personality and presence,
          selected one by one for shape, proportion, and wearability, guided by intention, not trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our design perspective is shaped by a meeting of cultures. Scandinavia brings clarity, restraint, and timeless silhouettes.
          Asia brings meaning, symbolism, and a deep relationship with adornment, where jewelry is more than an accessory.
          It carries identity, celebration and strength. Line &amp; Lustre brings these worlds together through clean, modern forms with nuanced detail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Created for duality, the collection moves between everyday signatures and statement moments, between a whisper of gold and a bold architectural line.
          Each piece is chosen for the fluid rhythm of modern life, effortless enough for a slow morning coffee, yet commanding enough for a midnight toast.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe in giving you that litt ekstra glans, the finishing touch that turns the everyday into something extraordinary.
          Because jewelry should not compete with you. It should sharpen the way you show up.
        </p>
